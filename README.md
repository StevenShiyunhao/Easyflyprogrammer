## Introduction 

This document explains how to use “Easyfly” software to write code into the offline programmer and use the programmer to flash the controller, daq card and hcu. If you have any trouble with this process please contact us by email (yunhao.shi@fftai.com) 

## Preparation

Since the Easyfly programming software works in Chinese version, the user interface will show messy code if user's computer applys different language environment. As the diagram shown below. The function of “Easyfly” won't affcted by the language. So following the operation instruction user can easily go through the programming process.

## Operation instruction
-  **Flash the code to offline programmer**  
   Open the Easyfly software first.

1) Choose the right controller "stem32" and the type "STM32F405xG"

2) Choose the number from 10-15 which corresponds to the number in the programmer.   
   Notice: Choosing the number smaller than 10 will cause unpredictable error.

3) Click to choose the file which will be witten into the programmer.  
   <img src="https://github.com/StevenShiyunhao/images-/blob/master/5.png" width = "70%" height = "70%" div align =center >
4) Click to write the file into the programmer

5) Wait untill it shows "编写成功！"

- **Programming your device with the offline programmer**

1. Keep the programmer power on with the USB connected to a power source. (Computer or a charger)
2. Connect the coding board and wire with the programmer.
3. Connect the other side of the wire with the target device.
4. Press the green button for 5 seconds to the file number page. Click the green button once a time untill to the right number (eg. 15)  
5. Press the green button for 5 seconds again to switch into the writing page
6. Press the green button for one click to flash the program into the device controller
7. Wait untill the screen show "编写成功" and with a beep which means the process is finished.
